# Pod Point React Components
The React DOM Components is a library of base styles and components designed for rapid prototyping for React Web projects, built with React and TypeScript.

## Getting Started
### Installation
```
npm install --save @pod-point/react-dom-components
```

### Development
```
git clone git@github.com:Pod-Point/react-dom-components.git
cd react-dom-components
npm install
```

### Tasks
To run a local development version of the components in Docz
```
npm run docz:dev
```

To run a build version of the components in Docz
```
npm run docz:build
```

To make edits to the TailwindCSS config or styles
```
npm run watch:tailwind
```

To build the TailwindCSS config or styles
```
npm run build:tailwind
```

### Linters and IDE setup
We use [Pod Point's React ESLint package](https://github.com/Pod-Point/eslint-config-podpoint-react) for React projects.
For CSS pattern consistency, we use a third party package called ```stylelint```. This is required as we are using Tailwind's ```@apply``` method in the custom CSS files.
To see how to set this up in VS Code, please refer to [this article.](https://www.meidev.co/blog/visual-studio-code-css-linting-with-tailwind/)


## Building components
- Add a new component by creating either a new folder or ```.tsx``` file under a current folder in ```src > components```.
- Add props/state types as a file in the ```src/interfaces``` folder.
- Add any tests into ```src/__tests___``` folder.
- Document the code by adding a ```.mdx``` file into ```__docz__``` folder, using the same file name as the component.


## Design and styles
This styleguide uses the utility-first CSS framework [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style components.

### Why TailwindCSS
Most CSS frameworks do too much, they come with all sorts of predesigned components like buttons, cards, and alerts that might help you move quickly at first,
but cause more pain than they cure when it comes time to make your site stand out with a custom design. <br />

### How to use TailwindCSS
Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework, therefore style elements by applying pre-existing classes directly in HTML tags. <br />
For example:
```
<button class="bg-green-primary text-white px-6 rounded text-center hover:bg-green-1">
  Button
</button>
```

### Customise TailwindCSS
Tailwind classes are generated from a config file found at the root of this project.
From here it is possible to add further classes, for example, ```colors``` for backgrounds, text, border etc. <br />

If custom styles are required, then a ```.css``` file can be added to ```src > styles > custom```.
These styles are built using [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/).


## Why Docz
Docz is an easy to use documentation generator, which takes advantage of MDX files alowing seamless use of JSX in markdown documents.
- Zero config and easy to learn. No unnecessary build steps with confusing setups.
- Blazing fast. Built with performance in mind from the start.
- Easy to customize. Create something that will be easy to use and customize.
- MDX based. The best standard for writing documentation.
- Pluggable. Plugins are the best choice when you need a custom and flexible solution.<br />
